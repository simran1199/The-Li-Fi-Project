# The-Li-Fi-Project
In this project we have done data transmission( like from simple text,photos to large files) using light(Li-Fi technology), Arduino IDE and Pyserial library(PYTHON).Then we have used it with Computer Vision using PiCamera to detect the vacant parking slot and transfer of vacancy data of slot using Li-Fi on the display screen of the vehicle waiting for parking.
